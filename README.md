# Intro
We are a team of high-skilled developers with more than 15 years in highload. 
We have developed thousands of projects, most of them work 10+ years, without  big issues. 
Without devops, without system administrators and big teams. Usually any developer in our team can solve all problems 
related to any very old project. We do not have processes. We have only results. And we are proud of that.

We used a lot of technologies within years. We have production on Erlang, Clojure, Perl, Php, Java, Kotlin, 
golang, Haskell, C, C++, Rust and many other languages. We remember MyISAMI and MySQL locks hell, we remember Apache, 
cgi, php. And we know how to handle a lot of traffic with a few resources. 
Most of our projects are related to financial operations - you can't lose any cent doing these things.

We start our book to share our experience  with you.
